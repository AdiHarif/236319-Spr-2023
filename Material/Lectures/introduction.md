# Introduction to C236319 / Programming Languages

## Proceudral vs. Declaractive Study
- *Procedural*: Driving, Swimming, Acting, Literature, History, Bible
- *Declarative*: Street Signs Math, Physics
Study of programmming languages:
- No theorems, integration by parts, ...
- Definitions are easy; lots of contents; you cannot simply memorize it
- Lots of fun
- Tools of the trade

## New ways of thought
- Productive programmers tend to know more programming languages
  - A real programmer can program in Fortran in any language
- Rich toolbox of programming techniques
- The Sapir Worf thesis: names of God, Jerusalem, Snow; tenses; Babylon 17, ...
- Classical studies (ancient, dead languages such as Greek and Latin) distill the main ideas
  - Typing
  - Evaluation
  - Functional programming
  - Logic programming

## The Four Main Paradigms
- Imperative paradigm
- Functional
- Object oriented
- Logical

## Languages covered in this course
You should be able to recognize the main concepts and how they appear in
 - Standard ML: Strong typing + Functional paradigm
 - Lisp/Mini Lisp: Symbolic computation; evaluation 
 - Pascal: Strong typing + procedural
 - Prolog: the logical paradigm
 - Java: the non OO parts
 - AWK, C, Bash, Go, Python... : to the extent presented


## Language Analysis Techniques
  1. Scope and Context
  2. Execution Model
  3. Concepts and Names

### Language Scope and Context
  - Vision and Price
  - Paradigm
  - Method of language definition 
  - Community
  - Standardization
  - Turing completeness

## Language Execution Model
  - Hello World
  - Extent of program
  - Interpreted, P-System or Compiled
  - Where does the program start? How does it end
  - Library vs. pre-defined vs. lockedin 

## Concepts and Names
 - Find the concepts: expression, threads, definition, labels,
     declaration, function, reference, traits, labels, macro, command,
     enumeration, procedure, class, type, module, template,
     monads,
 - Recursive relationship among concepts
 - Are they nameable? Can they be anonymous? Can they have multiple names?
